Network of 28-10-90 with 546 segments - SE corner region
  1	1	3	rungreens (0 or *1), g0method (*1 or 2), linmethod (1, 2 or *3)
  2  5 100		nmaxvessel,nmaxtissue,nmax - iteration limits - nmaxtissue=1 improves convergence
  1.e-3		errfac:  overall convergence tolerance (suggest 1e-5 to 1e-4)
  50.			lowflowcrit, criterion for low flow segment (suggest 50)
  26.0			P50 in mmHg
  2.55			n in Hill equation 
  0.5             Oxygen binding capacity of red cells in cm^3/cm^3/mmHg
  3.1e-5          Effective solubility of oxygen in blood in cm^3/cm^3/mmHg
  1.0		Factor to vary flows in network (normally use 1.0) - modified in GreensV4
  1		3	number of reacting species, species 1 is oxygen, number of tissue parameters per species
Solute 1 - oxygen
  1	1   1		permsolute, 0 or 1, diffsolute, 0 or 1; oxygen, 0 or 1, 1 if solute is oxygen
  100.		pref[] - typical maximum value, 100 mmHg
  4.2e-10         diff[] - tissue D*alpha in cm^3 O2/cm/s/mmHg
